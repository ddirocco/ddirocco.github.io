		<h1> About </h1>
		<p class="about-p">The arts have always played a leading role in my life. From the page to the screen, graphic design is how we contruct meaning within communication design. The graphic design program at Massachusetts College of Art and Design is a rigorous yet rewarding one. Concepts and design principles are taught with an unceasing consideration for the audience and their needs. We are problem solvers with an eye for composition, color, typograhy, and aesthetic.</p>
